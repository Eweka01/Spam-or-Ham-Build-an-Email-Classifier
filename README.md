# BEC Email Classifier Prototype

## Project Overview
This project involves developing a machine learning model to detect and classify emails as either benign or malicious in the context of Business Email Compromise (BEC). The system is designed to identify suspicious emails based on their textual content, which is a critical component in BEC detection. This project is part of a larger initiative to create a functional prototype for email filtering and security.

## Categories of Business Email Compromise (BEC):
- **CEO Fraud**
- **Account Compromise**
- **False Invoice Scheme**
- **Attorney Impersonation**
- **Data Theft**

## Purpose
The objective of this project is to build a system that uses machine learning techniques to classify emails. In a real-world scenario, such a system would assist in filtering suspicious emails before they reach inboxes, reducing the risk of BEC cybercrimes.

## Technical Stack
- **Python 3.9+**
- **scikit-learn** for model building and evaluation
- **pandas** for data manipulation
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive model development

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
